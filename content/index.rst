AI for Humanities
===========

This course has been created to help anyone from the humanities (and beyond) to be able to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) in their work. It has been designed in such a way that those who work through it can use AI tools developed by the community with understanding of how they work. This is not a comprehensive course in AI, but rather a course that provides the quickest route from humanities to using AI tools in your own work.

About the course
----------------
Since the current academic and vocational landscape is largely based on using digital tools, it's becoming a necessity to understand how to use those digital tools. AI (which is an umbrella term for machine learning and deep learning) is extremely useful, but the learning curve to use and modify these tools is very steep. This course aims to reduce the steepness in that learning curve, so that these tools are available to those who could benefit from using them.
