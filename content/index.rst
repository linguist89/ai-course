AI for Humanities
=================

This course has been created to help anyone from the humanities (and beyond) to be able to use Artificial Intelligence (AI) in their work. It has been designed in such a way that those who work through it can use AI tools developed by the community with understanding of how they work. This is not a comprehensive course in AI, but rather a course that provides the quickest route from humanities to using AI tools in your own work.

Who is the course for?
----------------------
The course is designed for anyone from the humanities, but people from other fields of study are also welcome.


About the course
----------------
Since the current academic and vocational landscape is largely based on using digital tools, it's becoming a necessity to understand how to use those digital tools. AI (which is an umbrella term for machine learning and deep learning) is extremely useful, but the learning curve to use and modify these tools is very steep. This course aims to reduce the steepness in that learning curve, so that these tools are available to those who could benefit from using them.

Case studies
------------
The course is in two parts: the lessons and the case studies. The lessons work like you would expect i.e. start at lesson 1 and work your way to the end. However, the case studies are there as examples and supplementary material which can help you understand the concepts better. When you have a problem that you are trying to solve, you can look at a case study that is similar to your problem. This can help you to understand how your own problem can be solved or give insights into possible ways in which it can be solved.
