<h1>Case study: Extracting entities from a text<a class="headerlink" href="#case-study-extracting-entities-from-a-text" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h1>
<p>When you are working from text data, you need to organize it in some way or another. Finding relevant information from the text can be difficult since text is written by people, it is often not very well structured. However, you can use an AI pipeline to help structure the text in a way that is useful. Using a library such as SpaCy can provide the fundamental textual organization that is needed to get an idea of what important entities are in a text. Entities are words that represent a person, location, time, date, organization, etc. Extracting these entities can provide a lot of information about the text.</p>
<p>The purpose of this case study is to illustrate how you get can specific pieces of information from a text to give you an overview of what is going on in the text. This can form the first part of a larger project such as determining the most important people in a text. You could also filter out all dates and create a timeline of events that happened in the text. Using location entities, you could extract all locations and plot them on a world map or local area map. A big project could incorporate all this into a geographical map that changes over time. The key to all this is to extract the entities so that they can be used in an effective way.</p>

<section id="data-preparation">
<h2>Data preparation<a class="headerlink" href="#data-preparation" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>Since SpaCy is a full library, it can take text in as input without needing to preprocess it. We will thus pass our text in as a string without any changes.</p>
</section>
<section id="model-selection">
<h2>Model selection<a class="headerlink" href="#model-selection" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>SpaCy has a wide range of models available depending on the specific task and they have also built-in support for HuggingFace models, so you can load any models from the HuggingFace repositories.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-processing">
<h2>Data processing<a class="headerlink" href="#data-processing" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>We simply pass the strings as input into the SpaCy pipeline then we get <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">spacy.tokens.doc.Doc</span></code> objects which contain a lot of information that has been extracted from the text through the pipeline.</p>
</section>
<section id="entity-extraction">
<h2>Entity extraction<a class="headerlink" href="#entity-extraction" title="Permalink to this headline"></a></h2>
<p>The Python code below is simply loading arbitrary text, using it as input in a Spacy pipeline and outputting all the entities. In addition, it is only outputting the entities that are listed as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PERSON</span></code> which, as the name suggests, are names of people. Looking through the tabs, you can see that there are three different variations of the same code i.e. Spacy small (en_core_web_sm), Spacy medium (en_core_web_md) and Spacy large (en_core_web_sm). These three variations illustrate how the results differ when using different pretrained models. The sizes refer to the sizes of the models themselves, so smaller models are small in size, but also less accurate while the larger the model becomes, the more accurate it becomes.</p>
<p>The best way to choose the appropriate model is to decide what is the best outcome for your project based on the results you want and the hardware (such as storage space, processing ability and time) you have available to you. There is not correct answer, but everything is dependent on the requirements of your project. Also present in the results is the fact that not all entities detected are valid names. Sometimes there are mistakes present, so it beneficial to decide what level of error can you accept in your project.</p>
